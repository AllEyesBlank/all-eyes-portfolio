      <p>When I was asked to be the keynote speaker at the LGBT Rainbow Banquet for Syracuse University back in my days as an undergraduate, I was introduced as being a "genuine and gentle person", a compliment that I have been striving to live up to ever since. I have a downright voracious appetite for learning and knowledge-- as my tenure in educational fields showcases, as well as my pursuit of higher degrees and certificates-- and I believe that the greatest way to indicate true understanding is to be able to lift up others in their understanding. With my years as a teaching assistant in academia complemented by my hard work in the service industry as a barista, shift lead and eventual assistant manager of various cafes, I hope my background inspires a sense of stability and discipline. More than a strong work ethic, though, I hope my leading quality is a generosity of spirit in helping teams achieve their goals.</p>

      <p>I turned to software engineering as I grew hungry for a new venue at which to throw my passion towards problem-solving and critical thinking. While I love literature and am grateful for my time studying it, I have found that nothing is quite so rewarding as thinking through and implementing elegant solutions to difficult technical problems, software engineering truly being one of the most hands-on ways to tackle the architecture of our modern world as it becomes increasingly tech-forward. I feel so lucky to be in this industry and have the opportunity to work on all scales of solutions.</p>
